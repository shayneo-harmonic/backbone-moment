**Public peoples, Please use the upstream version of this! This is simply a slightly modified version for use in an internal project. If you are however looking to use backbone-moment with NestedTypes, feel free to use this, however you might want to restore the 'include' lines (Our internal process has us mashing everything into a single js via gulp). Regards, Shayne from harmonic.

Backbone-moment
====================



## About Backbone-moment

This plugin modifies [Backbone.Model](http://backbonejs.org/#Model) adding a convenient getter/setter for date attributes using [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)

```js
var myModel = new Backbone.Model();

var fooDate = moment('1997-1-1');

myModel.setMoment('fooDate', fooDate, { silent: true });

myModel.get('fooDate'); // returns "1997-01-01T06:00:00+00:00"

moment.isMoment(myModel.getMoment('fooDate')); // is true

// [http://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-same/](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-same/)
myModel.getMoment('fooDate').isSame(fooDate); // is true
```
Additionally you can use the shorthand moment for getting and setting

```js
var fooDate = moment('1997-1-1');

myModel.moment('fooDate', fooDate, { silent: true });

myModel.moment('fooDate').isSame(fooDate); // is true
```

You can clear a moment by setting `undefined`, `null`, or ````
```js
myModel.moment('fooDate', undefined);

myModel.moment('fooDate'); // returns undefined
```


`Backbone.__moment` is a reference to moment.
If you have a modified or specially loaded moment, you will need to shim in a copy.
```js
require('backbone-moment');
Backbone.__moment = require('my-moment');
```

By default `backbone-moment` stores dates as UTC strings
Override `Backbone.Model.formatMoment` if you need to change this behavior
```js
var MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
  formatMoment: function(attr, date){
    return Backbone.__moment(date).utc().format();
  }
});
```
